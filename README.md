# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

This repository contains a Python script for a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game with a graphical user interface (GUI). The game allows a player to compete against the computer in this classic hand game. The player's choice is made through buttons on the GUI, and the computer's choice is randomly generated. The game keeps track of the player's and computer's scores, updating them after each round.

## Features

- **Easy-to-Use Interface**: The game features a straightforward GUI with three buttons representing the player's choices: Rock, Paper, and Scissors.
- **Dynamic Score Tracking**: Scores for both the player and the computer are displayed and updated after each round.
- **Immediate Outcome Display**: After each selection, the game displays both the player's choice and the computer's choice, along with the round's outcome.

## How It Works

- **Player Choice**: The player makes a choice by clicking one of the three buttons: Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
- **Computer Choice**: The computer randomly selects one of the three options.
- **Determine Winner**: The game compares the choices based on the classic rules:
    - Rock crushes Scissors
    - Scissors cuts Paper
    - Paper covers Rock

- **Update Score**: Based on the comparison, the game identifies the winner of the round and updates the score accordingly.
- **Display Results**: The choices and the winner of each round are displayed on the screen.
